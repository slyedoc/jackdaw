//! Load a scene authored in the editor, in a game that does not have the
//! editor.
//!
//! A game adds [`JackdawPlugin`], points a [`JackdawSceneRoot`] at a `.bsn`
//! file, and the scene's entities spawn under that root: transforms, brushes,
//! lights, cameras, UI canvases, glTF instances, and, under the features
//! below, terrain, colliders and a baked navmesh.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! App::new()
//!     .add_plugins((DefaultPlugins, jackdaw_runtime::JackdawPlugin))
//!     .add_systems(Startup, |mut commands: Commands, assets: Res<AssetServer>| {
//!         commands.spawn(JackdawSceneRoot(assets.load("scene.bsn")));
//!     })
//!     .run();
//! ```
//!
//! # What a game provides
//!
//! - **An asset folder**, as `AssetPlugin` was configured with: the `assets/`
//!   beside the executable unless the game said otherwise. Terrain sidecars
//!   and the catalog are read from it directly rather than through the asset
//!   server. Add [`JackdawPlugin`] *after* `DefaultPlugins` so it can see how
//!   `AssetPlugin` was configured. [`JackdawCatalogPath`] overrides the
//!   location for a game that keeps its project elsewhere.
//! - **[`JackdawAssetSourcePlugin`], for a project exported to the binary
//!   form**, added *before* `DefaultPlugins`: it registers the default asset
//!   source so a `.bsn` path handed to the asset server reads the `.bsb` twin
//!   when that is the form on disk. An asset source can only be registered
//!   before `AssetPlugin`, which is why this half is its own plugin.
//! - **A camera.** Scenes usually carry one. A game that spawns its own can
//!   mark it `TerrainViewer` so terrain lays its detail around the camera
//!   the player looks through rather than a UI overlay.
//!
//! No registration call, manifest or export step: the editor and the game
//! read the same files with the same code.
//!
//! # What it reads
//!
//! - `<scene>.bsn`: the scene, its entities and their components, plus inline
//!   `#Name` assets.
//! - Every `.bsn` under the asset folder that holds a registered asset type,
//!   loaded at startup into [`JackdawCatalog`] under the path it sits at, and
//!   under the `@Name` a reference written before paths spells. `catalog.bsn`
//!   is read after them for the entries that have no file of their own.
//! - `<scene>.terrain-<n>.jdterrain`: one terrain's heights, control map,
//!   colors and material slots, named by the `Terrain` component's `data_path`
//!   relative to the scene. Read under the `terrain` feature.
//! - `<scene>.jdnav`: the navmesh baked for that scene. Read under the
//!   `navmesh` feature onto the scene root as a `JackdawNavmesh`.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - `render` (default): draw what the scene authored. A build without it does
//!   not compile, because `jackdaw_scene_types` registers its types through
//!   its own `render` feature.
//! - `terrain`: draw the authored terrain. Implies `render` and `navmesh`.
//! - `navmesh`: load the baked navmesh without drawing anything. A server that
//!   validates moves is `render` plus `navmesh` and no `terrain`, which leaves
//!   out the mesher, the splat material and the texture loads.
//! - `physics`: build avian colliders from authored `AvianCollider`
//!   components. The game adds `PhysicsPlugins` itself to simulate them. With
//!   `terrain` as well, the authored ground gets a heightfield collider built
//!   from the heights it is drawn from.
//! - `animation`: play the animation sets a scene authored, binding each to
//!   the skeleton spawned under it. Off by default: a game with no rigs links
//!   neither Bevy's animation support nor its glTF loader.
//! - `pie`: play-in-editor, streaming this world to a running editor.
