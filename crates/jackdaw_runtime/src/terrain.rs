//! Terrain rendering in a built game.
//!
//! A scene's `Terrain` entities carry a scene-relative `data_path` naming a
//! `.jdterrain` sidecar beside the scene file. The sidecar decoder, splat
//! material and clipmap mesher all live in `jackdaw_terrain`, shared with the
//! editor. This module locates the sidecar, resolves the terrain's material
//! names against the project catalog, and follows the game's camera.
//!
//! With the `physics` feature enabled, the decoded heights also become a
//! heightfield collider.
//!
//! A sidecar that exists but fails to decode draws nothing, rather than
//! building ground from partial data. A missing sidecar is the flat-ground
//! case and is not an error.
