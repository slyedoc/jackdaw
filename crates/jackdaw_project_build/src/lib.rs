//! Editor-independent project build pipeline: from an open Bevy project
//! to a runnable artifact plus its extracted type schema.
//!
//! Depended on by the Jackdaw editor (for its in-process builds) and the
//! `jackdaw` CLI (`jackdaw build`). Kept bevy-light so the CLI stays
//! small and the pipeline is reusable outside the editor (for example a
//! Bevy CLI subcommand): only the `reflect` feature pulls bevy, and only
//! for the side that owns the reflected types.
//!
//! # Two build paths
//!
//! [`build_project_binary`] is what games use: the project is a normal
//! Bevy app, and `cargo build` in its root is the whole build. The game
//! keeps its own bevy, its own features, and its own toolchain. Schema
//! extraction runs the built binary with [`jackdaw_schema::SCHEMA_FLAG`].
//!
//! [`build_project_dylib`] is the SDK path for extensions, which must
//! share the editor's Bevy types and therefore compile against jackdaw's
//! prebuilt SDK so the artifact can be dlopened in-process.
