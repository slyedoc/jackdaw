//! Tier 2: the critical area-of-interest proof. Two clients connect into the
//! SAME zone and each must SEE the other player (room-scoped replication:
//! `Replicate(All)` on the entity plus a shared `Rooms` membership on both the
//! entity and each connection). Then one player is moved to a different zone and
//! both clients must lose sight of the cross-zone player (the room cull /
//! auto-despawn).
//!
//! Run: `cargo test -p jackdaw_multiplayer_lightyear --test tier2_aoi`
