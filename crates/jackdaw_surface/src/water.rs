//! A standard material that draws a lake, a river or a sea.
//!
//! [`Water`] extends [`StandardMaterial`] with what a flat mesh needs to read
//! as water: a surface that moves, a colour that darkens with how deep the bed
//! behind it lies, foam along the shore, caustics in the shallows and a wave
//! that lifts the vertices. It draws alpha-blended and casts no shadow, so the
//! bed under it stays lit.
//!
//! How deep the water is at a fragment comes from the scene depth behind the
//! surface, which is read from the camera's depth prepass. [`WaterPlugin`] puts
//! a [`DepthPrepass`] on the 3D cameras once a scene holds any water, since
//! without it there is nothing to compare the surface against: the shader then
//! falls back to full depth, which is the deep colour with no shore fade and no
//! foam.
//!
//! The scene's colour behind the surface is not reachable from a material
//! extension - the view's transmission texture is only filled for materials in
//! the transmissive phase, which an alpha-blended material never enters - so
//! [`Water::refraction_strength`] bends where the depth behind is read rather
//! than the image behind. The shallows and the foam wobble with the ripples;
//! the bed itself is not displaced.
//!
//! The wave, the depth blend and the foam are computed here as well as in the
//! shader, which is what the tests check: the two have to agree or a dial reads
//! one way in the inspector and another on screen.
