//! A standard material that blows with the scene's wind and lets light
//! through its leaves.
//!
//! [`Foliage`] extends [`StandardMaterial`] with the four things an imported
//! tree or bush needs to stop looking like cardboard: a cutout, a tint that
//! rises up the mesh, a colour variation read from where the plant stands, and
//! light coming through a leaf from behind it. Its vertices lean with
//! [`Wind`], the whole scene's, so a trunk bends at the top while a leaf card
//! flutters.
//!
//! Every dial defaults to the value that does nothing, so an unedited
//! [`Foliage`] draws exactly what its [`StandardMaterial`] half draws, cut out
//! at [`Foliage::alpha_cutoff`].
//!
//! The vertex offset, the gradient and the variation are computed here as well
//! as in the shader, which is what the tests check: the two have to agree or a
//! dial reads one way in the inspector and another on screen.
