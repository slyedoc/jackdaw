//! Physics simulation support for the editor's Physics tool.
//!
//! This module adds `PhysicsPlugins` to the app and exposes `PhysicsToolState`
//!  -- a resource that the editor's Physics tool uses to track its active run
//! (snapshots for undo, dragged entity, disabled bodies, sim-activation
//! state). Physics is paused by default on startup; the tool unpauses it
//! when the user first drags a selected entity, and pauses it again on
//! tool exit.
//!
//! Wiring the tool lifecycle (entering/exiting the mode, committing
//! transforms, handling keys) lives in the main jackdaw crate  -- this crate
//! stays jackdaw-agnostic and only provides the avian hookup + state types.
