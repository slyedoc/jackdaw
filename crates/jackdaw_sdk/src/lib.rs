//! SDK facade dylib shipped with Jackdaw.
//!
//! Extensions are built via `cargo rustc` with:
//!
//! ```text
//! -C prefer-dynamic
//! --extern bevy=<jackdaw>/target/debug/libjackdaw_sdk.so
//! --extern jackdaw_api=<jackdaw>/target/debug/libjackdaw_sdk.so
//! -L dependency=<jackdaw>/target/debug/deps
//! ```
//!
//! The `--extern` aliases rename this proxy as `bevy` and
//! `jackdaw_api` during compilation of the extension, so extension
//! code writes plain `use bevy::prelude::*;` and
//! `use jackdaw_api::prelude::*;`. Both resolve to this crate's
//! re-exports, which ultimately point at the shared `bevy_dylib` and
//! `jackdaw_dylib` runtimes loaded by the editor.
//!
//! Re-exports mirror `jackdaw_api`'s public surface. Editor-host
//! plumbing (loader plugin, catalog, enable/disable helpers) lives
//! behind `jackdaw_api_internal` and is deliberately not proxied.

/// Merged prelude serving both aliased names.
///
/// `use bevy::prelude::*` (aliased to `jackdaw_sdk::prelude`) and
/// `use jackdaw_api::prelude::*` (also aliased to
/// `jackdaw_sdk::prelude`) both land here. `bevy::prelude` and
/// `jackdaw_api::prelude` define a few same-named items (`Press`,
/// `Release` from `bevy_input` vs. `bevy_enhanced_input`). Extensions
/// referencing those unqualified will need to disambiguate; globbing
/// both is still the best UX since authors rarely touch the overlap.
