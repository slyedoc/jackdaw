//! Opening a project keeps the window drawing and says what it is doing.
//!
//! A project of any size used to reach the editor through a handful of frames
//! that each did everything: walking the assets, spawning the scene, handing
//! every model to the scene spawner. Nothing drew while they ran and nothing
//! said why. The steps below are spread over frames, and the footer names the
//! one running.
