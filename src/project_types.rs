//! project code into the editor would leak on every refresh. Instead
//! the out-of-process schema extractor
//! ([`jackdaw_schema`]) reports each type's shape, the
//! editor stores it here, and project components live as dynamic data
//! backed by the scene document. Their real types exist only in the
//! game binary at Play time.
//!
//! Only types the editor does NOT already know natively are kept here.
//! Native types (bevy, avian, jackdaw) keep their real registrations
//! and their existing real-component handling.
