//! Respawn the editor binary from within a running instance.
//!
//! Used to close the "runtime-loaded game can't register systems"
//! gap: after a game is scaffolded + built + installed, we need the
//! user's next session to pick it up at startup via
//! `DylibLoaderPlugin::build`, which is the only place we have
//! `&mut App` to hand the game's plugin. A full process restart is
//! the simplest way to get there.
//!
//! Also how the editor opens a project other than the one it
//! launched for. `AssetPlugin` fixes the asset root when the app is
//! built, so a second project can only be opened by a second
//! process: [`relaunch_into_project`] names it in the environment
//! the new process reads at startup.
//!
//! # What a reopen does not carry
//!
//! Only the project path crosses. The launcher's override cards
//! ("Open without setup", "Open anyway", "Not now") come back up in
//! the new process and want the same click again; carrying an answer
//! across would mean naming it in the environment beside the project.
//!
//! # A reopen never waits for shutdown
//!
//! [`relaunch_into_project`] is called in place of the app's exit, not
//! after it. Shutting down first can destroy the window while the
//! render thread is inside a swapchain present, and the process dies
//! there with the reopen never honored. Handing the process over
//! directly ends every thread at once, so nothing is left to race.
//!
//! # Why `exec` on Unix, `spawn + exit` on Windows
//!
//! On Unix we use `std::os::unix::process::CommandExt::exec` so
//! the new jackdaw takes over the current PID. This preserves:
//!
//! - The process-group membership (the terminal's foreground
//!   group), so a later Ctrl+C still reaches the new instance.
//! - `cargo run`'s wait loop (cargo is watching the original PID;
//!   exec keeps the same PID, so cargo sees the new process as the
//!   "still-running child" and doesn't prematurely drop back to
//!   the shell prompt).
//!
//! Windows has no `exec` equivalent; we fall back to spawning a
//! detached child and exiting. Terminal attachment there is
//! handled via the OS's process-management UI.
//!
//! The respawn inherits the full env (so `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` etc.
//! survive). Because jackdaw persists "recent projects" via
//! [`crate::project`], the new instance reopens the same project.
