//! Play-In-Editor runtime.

//! Builds the project with plain `cargo build`, launches the game's own

//! connection. Children stream `StateEvent`s back and respond to
//! `ControlEvent`s (Pause / Resume / Stop). Stop reaps the children; the
//! authored scene is never mutated.
//!
//! Instances are keyed by [`InstanceKey`] (config label plus 1-based

//! build, keyed by the project root: several instances wait on one build
//! and spawn together when it finishes.
