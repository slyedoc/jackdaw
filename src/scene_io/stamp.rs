//! Scene version stamp plus type-path migration on load.
//!
//! Saved scenes carry a leading comment recording the jackdaw and Bevy
//! versions that wrote them:
//!
//! ```text
//! // jackdaw 0.19.0 | bevy 0.19
//! ```
//!
//! The BSN lexer treats it as a comment, so it never reaches the parsed
//! document; the save regenerates it and the load scans the raw text for
//! it. Its purpose is provenance: when a future jackdaw built against a
//! newer Bevy opens an older scene, the recorded Bevy version selects the
//! type-path renames to apply, so a component whose reflect path moved in
//! a later Bevy still resolves. Bevy renames land on minor bumps, and the
//! stamp records the Bevy minor, so that is the granularity migration
//! keys on.
