//! Knife edit mode: incremental, multi-segment face bisection.
//!
//! Same shape as `BrushEditMode::Clip`. Pressing `K` with a brush
//! selected enters Knife mode; pressing `K` again or Escape exits and
//! discards any in-progress path.
//!
//! Each frame, the cursor snaps to the closest snap target within a
//! small tolerance. Priority order (highest first):
//!
//! - **Path-point snap**: any point already placed in the current path
//!   (large hollow red circle, outlined in white). Lets the user close
//!   loops.
//! - **Vertex snap**: solid filled red dot.
//! - **Edge midpoint snap** (Shift held): hollow red diamond.
//! - **Grid point snap** (translate snap active): red plus / cross.
//! - **Edge point snap**: small filled red square.
//! - **Face interior snap**: red X / cross. The cursor is over a face
//!   but not near any vert or edge; commit will add a Steiner point at
//!   this position and retriangulate the face.
//!
//! Vert and edge snap candidates are filtered by camera depth (clip-space
//! z): the candidate with the smallest depth wins, with screen distance
//! as the tiebreaker. This prevents the cursor from snapping to verts /
//! edges that live on a back-facing face occluded by the front face the
//! user is actually pointing at.
//!
//! LMB click commits the current snap target into the path. Enter
//! dispatches the `brush.knife.commit` operator, which bisects each
//! adjacent pair of points and is captured by the framework as a
//! single snapshot-diff undo entry. Esc or RMB cancels the in-progress
//! path.
//!
//! Commit handling: the path is applied to the `HalfedgeMesh` using
//! **topology mutations only** (no CDT). The pipeline mirrors how
//! the knife tool routes a multi-segment cut across faces.
//!
//! First, walk every path point in order, resolving each to a live
//! `VertKey` in the post-mutation mesh:
//!
//! - Vertex snap: position-lookup against the live mesh.
//! - Edge snap (`EdgePoint`, `EdgeMidpoint`): find a live edge whose
//!   endpoints flank the click position, then `split_edge` it. This
//!   handles the case where an earlier mutation has already split the
//!   original edge into two sub-edges; the search picks the live
//!   sub-edge that contains the click.
//! - Interior / Grid snap: pick the live face containing the click
//!   (point-in-polygon in the face plane) and `face_poke` it. Subsequent
//!   path points on the same original face look up which fan tri is
//!   alive now and route through it.
//! - Path-point reclick: inherits the resolved `VertKey` from its source.
//!
//! Then for each consecutive pair, perform a chord:
//!
//! - Both verts on the same live face's ring: `split_face`.
//! - Different live faces: cross-face routing. Find a face adjacent to
//!   `va` whose boundary the segment crosses, `split_edge` at the
//!   crossing, then recurse with the intermediate as the new `va`.
//!
//! If a segment can't be resolved cleanly (no path, adjacent verts that
//! can't chord, or already-collapsed pair), it's logged and skipped but
//! the commit continues. Catastrophic failures (rare) restore from the
//! pre-commit snapshot.
//!
//! Cut-through (project the cut through the whole brush
//! so the back face is cut simultaneously) is filed as task #97.
