//! Decide whether a keybind/operator gate should refuse because the
//! user is typing into a UI text input.
//!
//! Why a wrapper exists: Bevy's [`bevy::input_focus::InputFocus`]
//! `set_initial_focus` system runs in `PostStartup` and assigns the
//! `PrimaryWindow` entity as the focused entity when nothing else has
//! claimed focus yet. A gate written as `input_focus.get().is_none()`
//! therefore reads "user is typing" whenever the editor is in its
//! post-load steady state, and refuses the keybind. In production the
//! viewport-click handler clears focus, masking the bug; in headless
//! tests (and on the very first key press after launch) the gate
//! refuses spuriously.
//!
//! [`KeybindFocus`] returns `is_typing()` only when the focused entity
//! holds an editable text buffer. Recording a keybind chord suppresses the
//! keyboard the same way; [`KeybindFocus::keyboard_is_spoken_for`] answers
//! for both.
