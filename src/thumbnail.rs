//! Rendered thumbnails for the Project window's tiles.
//!
//! Without them a folder browses as a wall of identical font glyphs, which
//! makes a 300-entry kit unusable. This module photographs a model, a
//! material or a prefab off-screen once and caches the result as a PNG under
//! the project's `.jackdaw/thumbnails/`, so the second visit to a folder
//! costs a file read rather than a scene load and a GPU pass. A scene is not
//! photographed here: its picture is the viewport capture the editor takes
//! when the scene is saved.
//!
//! The off-screen setup copies [`crate::material_preview`]: a camera with
//! `RenderTarget::Image`, its own [`RenderLayers`] so nothing leaks into a
//! viewport, and its own [`EnvironmentMapLight`] because lighting is
//! per-view rather than global. It differs in two ways: one target image is
//! reused for every subject (the pixels are read back and written to disk, so
//! nothing needs to stay resident), and the whole thing is driven by a
//! bounded work queue rather than by a selection.
//!
//! Three rules the queue exists to keep:
//!
//! - **Never stall the editor.** At most one subject is rendered at a time
//!   and at most `DISK_LOADS_PER_FRAME` cached PNGs are decoded per frame.
//! - **Never re-render what is already on disk.** The cache is keyed by path
//!   *and* source mtime, so an edited file regenerates and an untouched one
//!   never does, across editor restarts. Only the subject's own file is
//!   keyed, so a material whose textures are edited under it keeps its
//!   picture until the material file itself is written again.
//! - **Never retry a file that failed.** A subject that cannot load is marked
//!   failed for that mtime and skipped until the file changes.
