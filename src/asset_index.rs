//! One index of every asset file the open project holds, keyed by the path the
//! file sits at under `assets/`.
//!
//! A path is the identity. An entry records what the file says it holds, the
//! kind that claims that type, the value the editor loaded from it and the
//! modification time the load saw, so a file rewritten by another tool reloads
//! into the handle references already point at. `by_id` turns a loaded handle
//! back into the path it came from, and `by_stem` resolves the bare names that
//! older scenes and sidecars still spell. The same walk records which documents
//! spell each file's path, so a card can say what a file is used by and a
//! delete can say what it would break.
//!
//! The index is built by one walk of the project's assets when the project
//! opens and kept in step by a watcher on the same directory. A kind the
//! editor has compiled in and loads elsewhere, such as an animation graph,
//! is listed here without a value.
