//! Painting per-cell data into a terrain: scatter-mask values (invisible
//! gameplay data) or splat control words (base/overlay texture ids and
//! blend).
//!
//! One modal operator drives both, switching on [`TerrainPaintState::domain`]:
//! driven by LMB, one history entry pushed on release, Escape restoring the
//! pre-stroke snapshot, Shift+scroll resizing the brush.
//!
//! [`PaintDomain::Channels`] values are integers, so the brush is a threshold
//! stamp rather than an accumulation: a cell inside the falloff is written, a
//! cell outside is left alone, and Ctrl paints 0.
//!
//! [`PaintDomain::Textures`] control words blend continuously, so the brush
//! nudges each cell every frame it is held. Primary paints the base texture
//! id and lowers blend toward it; Ctrl paints the overlay id and raises blend
//! toward it rather than erasing.
//!
//! [`PaintDomain::Color`] is the tint layer the splat material multiplies its
//! albedo by. It accumulates like the texture brush, and Ctrl paints white,
//! the layer's identity and so its eraser.
//!
//! [`PaintDomain::Detail`] is the coverage channel one detail layer grows from.
//! The brush eases cells toward its ceiling; Ctrl or Erase walks them to zero.
