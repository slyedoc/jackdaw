//! Selection, the selection outline, and direct manipulation for the 2D
//! viewport stage.
//!
//! A click hit-tests the authored UI rects the panel is showing and selects
//! the topmost one; the outline and its eight resize handles track that
//! node's live rect, and dragging either moves or resizes the authored
//! `Node` behind it, writing back through the scheme its author wrote (see
//! [`NodeAnchors`]). The overlay is editor chrome parented into the panel's
//! stage node, never into the authored tree. All of it is
//! [`Viewport2dMode::Edit`] behaviour. One gesture is at most one history
//! entry, handed over on release.
//!
//! Everything here is stated in the render-target pixels of
//! [`crate::viewport_2d::Ui2dView`], which are authored pixels. The only
//! conversions are the ones `viewport_2d` owns, composed in
//! [`cursor_stage_offset`] on the way in and inverted by
//! [`stage_pixels_per_target_pixel`] on the way out. There is no camera
//! term: Bevy renders UI through a view of its own, so a routed scene is
//! pinned to its render target whatever the 2D camera is doing.
