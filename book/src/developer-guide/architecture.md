# Architecture

Jackdaw is a standalone editor built from Bevy 0.19 plugin sets. The editor and the standalone
runtime share the same scene format and the same component
reflection. There's no separate engine; if you can write a Bevy
plugin, you can write a jackdaw extension.

## Plugin structure

The composable editor is delivered by `jackdaw_editor` as
`JackdawEditorPlugins`, a Bevy `PluginGroup`.
The editor binary looks like:

```rust
App::new()
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins.set(editor_window_plugin()))
    .add_plugins(EnhancedInputPlugin)
    .add_plugins(JackdawEditorPlugins::default())
    .run()
```

`JackdawEditorPlugins` pulls in everything jackdaw needs: the launcher,
viewport, hierarchy, inspector, brush tools, the Project window,
scene IO, and the extension loader. Game project code is not
compiled into this binary; the editor builds the project's own
cargo binary and talks to it out of process (see below).

The game's `main` adds `JackdawPlugin` from `jackdaw_runtime`,
which knows how to load authored scenes and answer schema
queries, but includes none of the editor UI. Gameplay usually
lives in a Bevy plugin (often named `GamePlugin`) that `main`
adds alongside it.

`WindowPlugin` is set by `editor_window_plugin()`.

## App states

The launcher and the editor are the same binary. The state
machine is:

- `AppState::ProjectSelect` is the launcher screen. Recent
  projects, new project, open existing.
- `AppState::Editor` is the editor proper. Once you pick a
  project, you stay here for the session.

You can read the transitions in `src/lib.rs` and
`src/project_select.rs`.

## Project code in the editor

A jackdaw game is a normal Bevy binary. When you open one, the
editor runs `cargo build` in the project root (sharing the user's
`Cargo.toml`, lockfile, target dir, and toolchain) and asks the
freshly built executable for its reflected type schema via
`--jackdaw-extract-schema`. The editor represents those types as
data rather than mapping game code into its process.

Play is the same artifact: the editor launches the project's own
binary as a child process and talks to it over IPC. What you Play
is what `cargo run` would run, and a game crash cannot take down
the editor.

Editor extensions build as dylibs against the SDK so they can
share the editor's Bevy types and load in-process.

## Scene format

Scenes are stored as `.bsn` files under `assets/`. Each entity
lists its reflected components inline. The live in-editor document
is the BSN AST (`SceneBsnAst`); saving writes it back out as
`.bsn` text, and that is the only format anything writes. The
serializer skips types tagged with `@EditorHidden`, the
entity-level `EditorHidden` marker, `NonSerializable`, and
`EditorOnly`. Legacy `.jsn` scenes can still be imported; see
[BSN Format](bsn-format.md).

Outside the editor, `jackdaw_runtime` registers a Bevy
`AssetLoader` for the `bsn` extension, since Bevy has no built-in
loader for the format. The loader processes scene entities in
topological order (parents before children) and bundles
`Transform`, `Visibility`, `GlobalTransform`,
`InheritedVisibility`, and `ChildOf` into a single `world.spawn`
per entity. User components go in afterwards, so `On<Insert, T>`
observers see correct hierarchy-derived state.

## Brushes

Brushes are jackdaw's CSG primitives, used for level geometry.
The data lives on the brush entity as a `Brush` component
(`faces: Vec<BrushFaceData>`, where each face carries a plane,
texture, material, and per-face UVs). Each face becomes a
child entity with a generated mesh; those children carry
`EditorHidden` and `NonSerializable` so they don't show in
the outliner and aren't saved (they're rebuilt from the
parent's `Brush` data on load).

Code:

- `src/brush/mod.rs` is the resource and component layer.
- `src/brush/mesh.rs` rebuilds face meshes when the brush
  changes.
- `src/brush/interaction.rs` is the editing state machine
  (face drag, vertex drag, edge drag).

## Inspector and picker

The inspector is modular. Each component type renders through a
display function that walks its reflected fields. The picker
that shows on `+ Add Component` enumerates the type registry,
filters out anything tagged `@EditorHidden`, and sorts by
category.

A field holding a handle is an asset field: the row shows the path
of the file behind it, with Pick, Clear and New beside it, and takes
a file dragged onto it from the Project window. Pick lists the files
the project holds of that field's asset type, and offers the
desktop's file dialog for a type with no asset files of its own,
such as an image. Every one of the three writes through the same
undoable field edit a scalar row uses, so one choice is one history
entry. A material's texture slots are the same row.

A project whose schema spells a reference as the path itself rather
than as a handle gets the row too: a string field of an asset whose
value names a file the project holds is shown as that file, and every
element of a list of them keeps the row even while it is empty, so a
list of material paths is picked from rather than typed.

Code:

- `src/inspector/mod.rs` is the dispatcher.
- `src/inspector/component_picker.rs` is the `+ Add Component`
  flow.
- `src/inspector/reflect_fields.rs` renders primitive fields.
- `src/inspector/asset_row.rs` renders a field that names an asset.

## Extensions

The editor can be extended by writing a normal Bevy library that
depends on `jackdaw_api` and implements the `JackdawExtension`
trait. Opening the extension project in jackdaw builds and loads
it; the Extensions dialog installs prebuilt extension dylibs.
Extensions can register operators, windows, menu entries, and
keybinds. See [Extending the Editor](extending-the-editor.md)
for the full story.

The dylib loader is `crates/jackdaw_loader`. The proxy dylib
that extensions link against is `crates/jackdaw_sdk`. The
rustc wrapper at `crates/jackdaw_rustc_wrapper` rewrites
`--extern bevy=...` so loaded extensions and the editor share
one compiled copy of bevy types.

## What's not here yet

The architecture page doesn't try to cover every system. The
big unfinished pieces (animation graph, asset processing
pipeline, and the rest) live in
[Open Challenges](open-challenges.md). The
[Crate Structure](crate-structure.md) page lists the workspace
crates and their roles.
